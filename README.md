# Gambling Optimization Algorithm for Crash Game #

This project is aimed at developing an optimization algorithm for the popular gambling game known as Crash. In this game, players are given a certain period of time to place bets and after the betting period expires, the odds progressively grow until the growth vector randomly crashes.

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can provide the best possible bet for this game in order to maximize profit. To achieve this, data will be collected from the site (without API) and analyzed. A mathematical optimization model will be developed using Pyomo and Highs. The model will be used to determine the optimal bet for each round of the game.

In addition, a simple website will be created where anyone can input historical data and run the optimization algorithm to determine the optimal bet for their specific case. The website will be developed using Python and Flask, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end web development.

The project will be developed using Python and the following libraries and technics:

- Pyomo
- Highs
- Flask
- Pandas
- requests
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for front-end web development)


The project is open-source, and contributions are welcome.
